# NcRegistry

The NcRegistry Go binary is a powerful command-line tool designed to streamline interaction with Docker registries. This tool is written in Go and provides users with an interactive prompt to select registries, view repositories, and manage Docker images and tags.

Key Features:

* **Registry Selection:** Connects to multiple Docker registries, allowing easy selection and switching.
* **Repository Browsing:** Fetches and displays the list of repositories in the selected registry.
* **Tag Management:** Fetches Docker tags and displays metadata, including creation dates and size. Enables actions such as pulling images and deleting manifests directly from the command-line interface.
* **Ease of Use:** Intuitive prompts guide the user through each action, simplifying complex operations.

This tool is a must-have for developers and administrators who frequently work with Docker and desire a more efficient and manageable way to interact with Docker registries.
